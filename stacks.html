        /* what is stack? abstract data structure 
        - a LIFO data structure!
        - the last element added to the stack will be the first element removed from the stack
        - How is it used? Think about a stack of plates, or a stack of markers, or a stack of ...anything.
        - As you pile it up the last thing(or the topmost thing) is what gets removed first
        - we saw this before, in the recursion call stack
        - What stacks are used for? 
                - Managing function invocations
                - undo / redo e.g. when you use photoshop
                - Routing (the history object) is treated like  a stack. e.g. in React uses it

        - there is more than one way to implementing a stack

        if you have a lot of data, you use linked list. it's more efficient

        we're not accessing the data based on index, so it's better to use linked list

        */

        /* Pushing pseudocode
        - the function should accept a value
        - create a new node with that value
        - if there are no nodes in the stack, set the first and last property to be the new created node
        - if there is at least one node, create a variable that stores the currrent first property on the stack
        - reset the first property to be the newly created node
        - set the next property on the node to be the previously created variable 
        - increment the size of the stack by 1
